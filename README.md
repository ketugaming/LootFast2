# LootFast2

This is a rewrite of the original LootFast addon by Kajikami.

Allows you to set whether items should be looted by name and by item quality, and allows auto greed rolls and auto BoP item pick up. This mod does not actually replace the loot all feature, it works in addition to it. If you autoloot a mob, it will still be autolooted if LootFast is running. To loot only items chosen by LootFast, simply loot without using loot all.

Warning: this mod is intended to be used for soloing/grinding. It is not intended to be used in raids, and could easily turn you into a ninja if used incorrectly.

This latest version includes an options GUI to assist in setting up LootFast to your liking.

## Known Issues

* Sometimes the options GUI will not load your name filters. To fix this, just reopen the options GUI and they should appear in the name filter list.
